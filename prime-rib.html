        <h3>Ingredients for rib roast</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>1 (10 pound) standing rib roast</strong>, 3 to 7 ribs
                (estimate serving 2-3 people per rib), bones cut away
                from the roast and tied back to the roast with kitchen
                string (ask your butcher to prepare the roast this way)
            </li>

            <li>
                Salt
            </li>

            <li>
                Freshly ground black pepper
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Liberally season the prime rib with salt and pepper
                 and refrigerate overnight.
            </li>

            <li>
                An hour before cooking, remove the roast from the refrigerator
                to allow it to come to room temperature
            </li>

            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to <strong>400 degrees F</Fieldset></strong></li>

            <li>Put the reserved ribs in a roasting pan bowed-side up (the ribs will be acting
                as the roasting rack). Scatter any fat and meat trimmings in the pan around
                the bones. Roast the bones and trimmings for about <strong>30 minutes</strong>, or
                until the fat starts to render.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove the pand from the oven, put the rosemary sprigs on top of the bones,
                then top with the prime rib. Put the smashed garlic in the bottom of the pan with the trimmings 
                Baste the beef with the fat drippings and return the pan to the oven
            </li>

            <li>
                Cook for <strong>30 minutes</strong> and then baste the roast again.</li>
  
            <li>
                Reduce the heat to <strong>350 degrees F</strong> and cook until the meat is 
                medium rare (internal temperature of 125 degrees F to 130 degrees F), about 1 hour,
                15 minutes, basting the roast every 30 minutes until it is done. Keep in mind that
                the roast will continue to cook while resting.
            </li>

            <li>
                Remove the roast from the oven and put it on a cutting board to rest, uncovered, 
                for 20 minutes. Slice the prime rib to the desired thickness and garnish 
                with the arugula and olive oil.
