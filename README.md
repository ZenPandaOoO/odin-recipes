Self Reflection:

     I went into this project with confidence after taking plenty of time to memorize the boilerplate, image format, and other tools needed to make my first 'website'. However, the hardest part for me was create a repository in GitHub and connecting it to my LOCAL machine. I ran into an error where I had created a directory on my LOCAL machine called odin-recipes and in that directory, I tried connected the repo which was also titled odin-recipes. This would have been redundant and cause more keystrokes than desire. To delete the linked repo I ran into some issues which were solved through trial and error. The rest of the project went smoothly.
